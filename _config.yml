  I am a recent engineering graduate of the University of Alberta. 
  My study and work have involved a substantial amount of data collected from experiments, operations, and simulations, and I enjoy taking logical approaches to analyze, model, and visualize data, as well as communicating the results with stakeholders. 
  Before pursuing my bachelorâ€™s degree in engineering, I have earned a business diploma in accounting. 
  The financial concepts and accounting knowledge I learned have helped me to better understand and analyze problems from a business perspective. 
  People who have worked with me would describe me as an analytical, reliable individual who maintains a positive, proactive attitude when faced with adversity. 
  Currently, I am looking for opportunities that can make positive impacts on organizations with my skills and abilities.
